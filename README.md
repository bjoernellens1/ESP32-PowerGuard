# ESP32-PowerGuard - Digitalization in Energy Engineering

This repository contains the source code for our university group project focused on digitalizing energy engineering in the industrial sector. Our project aims to retrofit mobile robots with capable mini PCs while addressing a critical issueâ€”two PC failures due to a faulty power converter. Collaborating with the electrical engineering department, we are identifying and mitigating faults.

Key Features:

    ESP32-based power monitoring for voltage and consumption.
    Integration of 2 relay boards to prevent unforeseen voltage conditions.
    Data logging to InfluxDB for comprehensive analysis.
    Grafana dashboard for visualizing power conditions.
    Embedded webserver on ESP32 for real-time voltage and power readings and relay control.
